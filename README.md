The navigation bar is created using an unordered list ('ul') and list items ('li'). The "Home" list item is marked as "active."

The page is divided into different sections using <div> elements with class names "main1," "main2," and "main3."
The first section contains an image displayed at full width and a fixed height.
The second section contains three images arranged horizontally with a margin between them.
The third section ("main3") has a black background and contains a paragraph (<p>) and an image displayed side by side.
